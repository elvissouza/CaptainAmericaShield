          <p class="text-indent">
            During the dark days of the early 1940's a covert US military
            experiment turned him into Americas first Super-Soldier, Captain
            America. Throughout the war, Cap and his partner Bucky (James
            Buchanan Barnes) fought alongside infantry and with a group of
            heroes known as the Invaders. In the closing months of World War II,
            Captain America and Bucky were both presumed dead in an explosion.
            Decades later, Captain America was found trapped in ice and revived
            in the modern world. He later worked with other heroes and became a
            member, and later leader of The Avengers.
