            <h2>Origins In The Golden Age</h2>
            <div class="content">
                Simon and Kirby created Steve Rogers, a would-be army enlistee rejected by recruiters because of his
                small size. Rogers volunteers to receive a top-secret serum, and he is transformed into a “super
                soldier.” Dubbed Captain America and clad in a red, white, and blue costume with a matching
                stars-and-stripes shield, Rogers joins the U.S. Army, acquires a kid sidekick—plucky regimental mascot
                Bucky Barnes—and embarks on a career of enthusiastic Nazi-bashing.<br/><br/>

                The early stories were simple, straightforward tales peopled with bizarre villains such as the Hunchback
                of Hollywood, the Black Toad, and Ivan the Terrible. Chief among them was the Red Skull, a seemingly
                invincible Nazi whose face literally was a crimson skull. The stories of derring-do were gripping and
                fast-moving, and the comic became one of the most widely read titles of the so-called Golden Age of
                comics. Audience identification with Captain America was central to that success. The first issue
                announced the creation of “The Sentinels of Liberty” fan club; eager young readers could join for just a
                dime, which entitled them to a membership card and a metal badge. The club proved so popular that its
                badge promotion had to be discontinued because of wartime metal rationing.<br/><br/>
